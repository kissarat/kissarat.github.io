# Taras Labiak


## Summary
I love to investigate, to solve, to describe, to analyse and give accurate estimates. I prefer to probe and prove diverse approaches in my life and in the projects where it possible. I avoid talks and meetings "with existentialism" and may make transactional analysis to avoid existential questions in the future. I'm pragmatic and I guess that philosophy is a friend of developer. Any intelligent person must know psychology enough to communicate efficiently and motivate coworkers. I want to work with constructive people. Life is too short to be unresponsible.

I love astronomy, physics, mathematics, ethics, meditation and yoga. I'm a skeptic and often intend to find out where and how opponent (or me) may be right or wrong. I prefer to live with some constructive illusions but without a lie. Life is amazing and I try to learn as much as possible from my experience.
